# Commit message format

When generating commit messages (e.g. from the Git tab), use **Conventional Commits with scope**.

## What to emphasize

Focus the message on **merits and the most important changes**—what actually matters to someone reading history:

- **Prioritize**: architecture (new modules, boundaries), behavior (new features, fixes, flows), API or wire changes, removals or migrations.
- **Do not** lead with refactors, renames, or style. If a commit is mostly refactor/style, say so briefly; if it contains major architectural or behavioral changes, **lead with those** in the subject and body.
- Read the diff for substance: new capabilities, fixed bugs, changed contracts—then summarize those first.

## Structure

1. **Subject line**: `type(scope): short summary`
   - **type**: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`, `style`, `perf`
   - **scope**: area of the codebase, e.g. `backend`, `frontend`, `schema-utils`
   - **summary**: imperative, lowercase start, no period; ~50–72 chars

2. **Body** (optional, after a blank line): bullet list of main changes.

## Example

```
refactor(schema-utils): add strict schema validity checks

- Add schemaValidity module with strict mode
- Update validate to use shared types
```

## Rules

- Lead with impact: subject and first bullets describe architectural or behavioral changes when both are present.
- Prefer a scope when the change touches a clear area (backend, frontend, schema-utils).
- Use the body when there are multiple distinct changes.
- Do not use past tense in the subject ("added" → "add").
